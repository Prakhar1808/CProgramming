# Setting Up Local C Environment
this is not part of the syllabus but helps build problem solving skills, but you CAN get away without setting up a local env.
> note even though using an online compiler won't harm but, setting up local C environment and working on the code locally will help a lot in understanding the process and new skills will be learnt along the way!

## Option 1: Minimal Setup (not local)
- onlinegdb.com / replit.com
- Use online compilers (usually suggested by the faculty)

## Option 2: Local Compiler Setup
### Windows
1. Install MinGW or Code::Blocks or MSYS2
2. Add to PATH
3. Verify: `gcc --version`

> checking online documentation provided on the software's website is always encouraged. Reading Documentation increases problem solving and reduces dependency on spoon-feed information

### Mac/Linux
1. Install Xcode Command Line Tools or build-essential
2. Terminal: `gcc -v`

> on linux gcc is usually pre-installed, compiling and executing code is can be done right away (almost)

## Option 3: IDE Setup (Extra)
- VS Codium with C/C++ extension
- CLion (for advanced users)
- Dev-C++ (beginner friendly)
- Turbo C (also used in a lot of college machines)
- terminal based "IDEs" **i use neovim btw**

**Why go beyond online compilers?**
- Learn the actual compilation process
- Understand file management
- Debugging tools availability
- Professional development skills
